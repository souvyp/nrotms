Autumn marks the transition from summer into winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere)
when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier. The equinoxes might be expected to be in the middle of their respective seasons, but temperature lag (caused by the thermal latency of the ground and sea) means that seasons appear later than dates calculated from a purely astronomical perspective.</p>		<p class='like'>12 Likes</p>		<p class='theme'>Nature, Red</p>	</div></div><div class='list-item box'>	<div class='img left'>		<img src='/content/img/thumbs/arch-1.jpg' alt='' title=''/>	</div>	<div class='block right'>		<p class='title'>Arch</p>		<p class='desc'>An arch is a structure that spans a space and supports a load.

It is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven with magnetic fields. It has a diameter
of about 1,392,000 km, about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass  accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, while the rest is mostly helium.
The remainder (1.69%, which nonetheless equals 5,628 times the mass of Earth) consists of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron, among others.</p>		<p class='like'>81 Likes</p>		<p class='theme'>Nature, Red</p>	</div></div></div>
